      <p>Highly selective and academically rigorous, Ivy league schools are often touted as some of the most prestigious universities in the United States and around the world. In a recent  <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities">ranking </a> by USnews of the top colleges across the U.S., Ivy League schools dominated the top, with all eight placing in the top 17. So, it would seem that there is no better option for prospective college students than to attend an ivy league institution. </p>

      <p>However, attending a four-year college is now more expensive than ever. According to the <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college">Education Data Initiative</a> the annual cost of attending a four-year university has more than doubled in the 21st century, with a yearly growth rate of 6.8 percent. </p>

      <p>Ivy League schools are not immune from this. In addition to being some of the most prestigious universities in the country, they are also some of the most expensive; in a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-colleges-in-the-us-2017-2#2-columbia-university-49"> ranking </a> of the 50 most expensive colleges to attend in the United States done by business insider, six ivies placed on the list, with Columbia clocking in as the 3rd most expensive college in the United States. </p>

      <p>In addition to being some of the most expensive colleges in the country, Ivy League schools are also among the most <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/the-most-selective-colleges-in-the-us">selective</a>. All eight schools combined had an average acceptance rate of 5.4 percent, making them some of the most selective colleges in the country. </p>

      <p>Ivies also have a reputation for being elitist institutions that cater to the wealthiest Americans. As <a href="https://time.com/5676174/universities-equality-eliteness/">Time Magazine</a> put it, "elite schooling has become the dynastic technology of choice for the one percent." </p>
      
      <p>Given their low admissions rate, high cost of attendance, and reputation for being elitist institutions, it begs the question. Are ivy league schools even worth applying to, let alone attending anymore?</p>
      
      <p>For one high school student, the answer is no. Julie Huffman is a rising senior who attends Great Valley High School in Malvern, PA. Huffman said on the topic of attending Ivy League schools, "personally I don't think I will; I don't see it as being a very good fit for me"</p>
      
      <p>Elaborating on her answer, Huffman said that she doesn't see herself applying to an Ivy League school because she's not quite sure what she wants to major in in college. Due to the competitive nature of Ivy league, she feels that would be a hindrance saying in part "I feel like if you want to attend an Ivy League school, you should at least have an idea of what you want to do, or at least a path laid out, which is something I don't have yet."</p>

      <p>The low acceptance rates of ivy league schools make it unlikely for them to take multiple students from the high school. Huffman added that she believes this further pushes high school students looking to attend Ivy League schools to try that much harder to stand out on their college applications by taking all AP courses or enrolling in year-round SAT prep courses.</p>
      
      <p>Huffman said that was not something she was looking for in the college application process, saying, "I try hard in school, believe me, but I don't try that hard."</p>

      <p>Looking into the professional world, it's not hard to see why some high school students are shying away from applying to Ivy League schools. Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris attended an Ivy League school, marking the first time in <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-would-joe-biden-first-president-80-90-years-who-not-ivy-league-graduate-1538439">44 years</a>that neither the president or vice president has attended an Ivy League school.</p>

      <p>In spite of the recent trend of higher-ups and government officials trending away from Ivy Leagues and the many factors that might push people away from attending, there are still plenty of positives to attending an Ivy League school.</p>

      <p>Ivy League schools do have an extremely high cost of attendance. However, they can remain relatively affordable for students because of financial aid. In a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic"> ranking </a> of the best schools to attend based on value; Yale, Harvard, and Princeton all placed within the top 5 best value schools in the country, with yale ranking as number one.</p>

      <p>During the 2021 academic year, 57 percent of all students that went to yale were awarded financial aid, with an average of $60,494 per student. So, while Ivy Leagues may have insanely high sticker prices, the actual cost of attendance is often much lower.</p>

      <div class="col"><iframe title="Where our Senators went to College. " aria-label="Election Donut" id="datawrapper-chart-3jWOV" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3jWOV/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="297"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>

      <p>Similarly, the reputation that Ivies have of being an elitist boys club, which can still be true, is slowly fading away with time. Kristin long, a Princeton Graduate said that "one of the things that I found really refreshing and surprising when I went to Princeton is that there were so many people who didn't fit that dynamic"</p>

      <p>One of the most significant benefits to attending an ivy league school is the alumni network. Long, now a professor at Boston University, said on Princeton's alumni network, "at the ivies, where there are hundreds of years of tradition, there is so much pride, it's just on a different level." Adding further "its also about the networks that you gain access to while simply being a student there, and those networks are deep." </p>

      <p>In addition to having extensive and powerful alumni networks, ivy league schools are also some of the most prestigious academic universities across the country. Long said on the instruction she received while at Princeton, "the faculty there is fantastic, the education students receive truly is top of the line" </p>

      <p>So, while ivy league schools may have their drawbacks, they also certainly have their positives. And while they may not be the right choice for everyone, the universities have certainly had their benefits for those who attended them. So it truly is up to the individual if ivy league schools are worth it. </p>
